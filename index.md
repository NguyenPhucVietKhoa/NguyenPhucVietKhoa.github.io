## About

I am a PhD student in computational mechanics at [ONERA Lille](https://www.onera.fr/fr) and [Université Polytechnique Hauts-de-France](https://www.uphf.fr/).

I hold an Engineer's degree in Mechanical Engineering and Design and a Master's degree in Computational Mechanics, both at [INSA Centre Val de Loire](https://insa-centrevaldeloire.fr/fr/).

During my academic journey, I interned at prominent companies in France. In 2023, I worked as a mechanical simulation engineer intern at [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html) Tours, specializing in simulating and modeling the thermal deformation of Silicon Wafers. I also had the chance to spend time as an intern at [CAILLAU](https://www.caillau.com/?lang=fr), where I was part of the R&D team, focusing on the research and development of Cooling Plates for the Battery Modules of Electric Vehicles.
